# task1_ELEVEN_LABS
This repository was created to report my results on the first summer intership ELEVEN LABS task

In this task, I have found four hosts at my network, including mine, I did a portscan  in all of the hosts and had interesting results. The tests have been realized in a Kali Linux virtual machine and the hole process I have did is inside the pdf.
